## Description
At MyScript we are building handwriting recognition technologies for more than 15 years. Recently we build a polymer component easing the integration of hand recognition in your webapp. We will briefly demo the different kind of technology accessible with our techno (Text, Math, Music ...) , how it works behind the scene with machine learning and then live-code an app with handwriting recognition.

## Demo 1
This demo bring Math handwriting recognition in a simple html application by using myscript-math-web.

## Demo 2
This demo bring Text handwriting recognition in a simple html application by using myscript-text-web.
